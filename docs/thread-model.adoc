# Duna Thread Model

The thread model should follow these rules:

    * an outbound event can be emitted by any thread, but incoming events should be processed
      by the same thread;
    * all consumers and flowable emitters registered under a subscriber must run sequentially,
      never in parallel;
    * the event bus can be called from any thread.
